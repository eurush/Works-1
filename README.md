### C++ Works
Projects made entirely using C++
- Comparision of Sorting Algoritms : Image Processing using C++, use case is shown by implementing benchmarking plots for comparing different sorting algorithms
- Term256 : Graphics Library using C++, animations will be shown in Terminal.
- FileIO : Fun project trying using FileIO to display big ASCII charcters.

Details are in individual READMEs.

### Processing works
Simulation based projects, there are screenrecoreded videos of individual simulaions inside READMEs.

1. Fliud Simulation : Based on 2006 paper on [Fluid Simulation for Dummies by Mike Ash](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)
2. Practice Projects : Contains other Physics simulation based projects 
   - Spring Mass system using [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/)
   - Text Morphing, animating text changing from one word to another word for given Font.
   - Quad Tree structure for fast search in 2D plane.
   - Self Assembling Points, points that gets to thier original position after being disrupted. 
   And many more projects mentioned in the archive inside README file.

3. ASCII art : Drawing images using only ASCII characters

### CP template
Consist of handy Competitive Programming templates that are frequently used, more detailed description is in README file.

#### Python-works, MATLAB-works, BAT and AI stuff
These folders consist of either fun stuff or very basic applications like 
1. Made basic chat application using Socket Programming in python
2. BAT as in Batch scripting file, tried to make generic array structure that can take any datatype into it
3. Have few old codes which remains uncompleted . . . (⌣̩̩́_⌣̩̩̀), will start continuing them soon. . . .
